Hey! Welcome to the changelogs! No idea how you got here to begin with but while you're already here, 
might aswell tell you about every single detail of every single bot version that has ever been worked on by me.
Nah jk, I'm a lazy piece of shit that won't look into this .txt for months, can't expect me to list every single change here.
Anyways, not quite sure why you're still here but lets go!

The Idea - v0 (pre 10.11.2020)
Long story short, I was hanging out on a discord server playing league of legends with 4 of my friends. 
One of them (A.) ran it down mid like the bronze 4 he is, so naturally another friend of mine (G.) started shittalking a little. Nothing big.
All chill. Well, friend A. didn't really enjoy the trashtalk so he quickly muted him client-sided. 
The admin of the server (@xSparfuchs) and I (@termilu) figured we needed some sort of Trustfactor score on the server, like csgo implemented years ago.
After a few days I figured might aswell code one myself. Yeah. Great idea. Thanks me. :).


The Start - v0.1 

TO BE CONTINUED






*** -vXX (16.11.2020)
Implemented a -help command, tried to create -snipe command with DeleteListener but realized it's just not gonna happen now is it.
Integrated OffsetDateTime time, started changelog.txt, tried my hands on a bunch of problems regarding not being able to read info from the messages
that the bot just sent. Its 7:15am. Think I'm just gonna leave it for the day lol.
